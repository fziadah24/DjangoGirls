        <p>WE GOT TO SCHOOL AT 2:45 IN THE MORNING! WHEN WE GOT TO THE CAREER CENTER, THERE WERE COPS IN THE PARKING LOT, WHICH WAS STRANGE. SLOWLY, EACH STUDENT BEGAN SHOWING UP ONE BY ONE. EVENTUALLY, WE WERE ALL THERE AND JEFF PULLED UP IN THE BLACK VAN AROUND 2:56. THAT PROBABLY LOOKED SO SUSPICIOUS! WE SPENT A LONG TIME IN THE VAN (4 HOURS). OLIVE AND BLU HAD A MINI CONCERT IN THE BACKSEAT WHILE EVERYONE WAS TRYING TO SLEEP. WE FINALLY GOT TO PITTSBURGH AROUND 7:32 THAT MORNING! </p>

            <p>ONCE WE GOT INTO PITTSBURGH, WE FOUND OUR HOTEL. THE ENTRANCE WAS VERY SMALL AND WE ALMOST COULDN'T FIT THE VAN THROUGH, BUT WE MANAGED IN THE END. OUR ROOMS WEREN'T READY, SO WE DECIDED TO LEAVE OUR LUGGAGE ON A CART, AND HEAD TO THE CONVENTION CENTER. JEFF WENT TO PARK THE VAN AND GRAB BREAKFAST. THE REST OF US WALKED TO THE CONVENTION CENTER (ALMOST WENT THE WRONG WAY). ONCE THERE, WE GOT OUR BADGES AND 3 BANNERS TO ATTACH TO IT: EDUCATION SUMMIT, FIRST TIME ATTENDEE, AND POSTER PRESENTER!</p>

OLIVE AND BLU TOOK SOME <a href="https://github.com/olivejeng/pycon_notes/tree/main/education_summit/RiseToTheChallenge">NOTES</a> ON THINGS WE FOUND INTERESTING. EVENTUALLY IT WAS TIME TO TAKE A BREAK SO OLIVE, BLU AND SHEEL WALKED BACK TO THE HOTEL SO WE COULD GRAB SOME STUFF WE WANTED FOR THE DAY. WE THEN HEADED BACK TO THE CONVENTION CENTER!</p>

MAYAH AND KIERSTEN DISAPPEAR SO WE WAITED OUTSIDE FOR THEM TO COME BACK. WHILE WAITING OUTSIDE WE DECIDED THAT PITTSBURGH WASN'T A VERY SECURE CITY. THEN, WE WALKED BACK TO THE HOTEL.</p>
