AS SOON AS WE GOT DOWN TO THE LOBBY, WE NOTICED JEFF AT ON OF THE TABLES GRADING EMAILS. HE WAS SO FOCUSED HE DIDN'T EVEN SEE US. WE WALKED OVER TO SAY HI, THEN WE GOT TO MEET ONE OF JEFF'S FRIENDS THAT COMES TO PYCON EVERY YEAR. HE GAVE US REALLY NICE MOLESKIN NOTEBOOKS!! WE ATE BREAKFAST THEN WENT BACK TO THE ROOM TO GET READY FOR THE DAY.</p>

WE GOT TO THE CONVENTION ADN PICKED UP T-SHIRTS AND SWAG AT THE SWAG TABLE. WE GOT THERE EARLY ENOUGH THAT THE EXPO HALL A WASN'T OPEN YET, BUT WE DECIDED TO WALK AROUND ANYWAY. WE GOT SOME STICKERS, SOME OTHER SMALL GIVEAWAYS THEN GOT BREAKFAST. ONCE THE EXPO HALL OPENED, WE SAT IN ON SOME DEMOS. OUR FAVORITE WAS ONE ON <a href="https://anvil.works/">ANVIL</a> AND <a href="https://py.space/">PY.SPACE</a>. AS STUDENTS WHO ARE ACTIVELY LEARNING PYTHON, IT COULD BE A GREAT TOOL TO USE. BLU ENDED UP DOWNLOADING ANVIL AND MAKING AN APP ON IT! WE THEN HEADED TO EXPO HALL B FOR THE OPENING KEYNOTE. JEFF WANTED US TO GET GOOD SEATS, SO WE WERE ABOUT 15 MINUTES EARLY. SLOWLY MORE PEOPLE STARTED SHOWING UP AS WELL AS A FEW MORE OF OUR GROUP MEMBERS.</p>
