AS SOON AS WE GOT DOWN TO THE LOBBY, WE NOTICED JEFF AT ON OF THE TABLES GRADING EMAILS. HE WAS SO FOCUSED HE DIDN'T EVEN SEE US. WE WALKED OVER TO SAY HI, THEN WE GOT TO MEET ONE OF JEFF'S FRIENDS THAT COMES TO PYCON EVERY YEAR. HE GAVE US REALLY NICE MOLESKIN NOTEBOOKS!! WE ATE BREAKFAST THEN WENT BACK TO THE ROOM TO GET READY FOR THE DAY.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 84%; margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 64%;">WE DECIDED THAT WE WANTED STARBUCKS SO WE STOPPED BY ON THE WAY TO THE CONVENTION CENTER. IT WAS DELICIOUS! WE GOT TO THE CONVENTION ADN PICKED UP T-SHIRTS AND SWAG AT THE SWAG TABLE. WE GOT THERE EARLY ENOUGH THAT THE EXPO HALL A WASN'T OPEN YET, BUT WE DECIDED TO WALK AROUND ANYWAY. WE GOT SOME STICKERS, SOME OTHER SMALL GIVEAWAYS THEN GOT BREAKFAST. ONCE THE EXPO HALL OPENED, WE SAT IN ON SOME DEMOS. OUR FAVORITE WAS ONE ON <a href="https://anvil.works/">ANVIL</a> AND <a href="https://py.space/">PY.SPACE</a>. AS STUDENTS WHO ARE ACTIVELY LEARNING PYTHON, IT COULD BE A GREAT TOOL TO USE. BLU ENDED UP DOWNLOADING ANVIL AND MAKING AN APP ON IT! WE THEN HEADED TO EXPO HALL B FOR THE OPENING KEYNOTE. JEFF WANTED US TO GET GOOD SEATS, SO WE WERE ABOUT 15 MINUTES EARLY. SLOWLY MORE PEOPLE STARTED SHOWING UP AS WELL AS A FEW MORE OF OUR GROUP MEMBERS.</p>

WE FOUND OUT THAT THE THEME OF PYCON THIS YEAR IS ICE CREAM! OLIVE LEARNED THAT PSF STANDS FOR PYTHON SOFWARE FOUNDATION. THERE WERE A FEW MORE KEYNOTES, THEN WE WENT BACK TO THE EXPO HALL TO COLLECT MORE GOODIES. WE WENT FROM BOOTH TO BOOTH CHATTING ABOUT TECHNOLOGY. BLU ENDED UP TALKING TO SOMEONE ABOUT SPENDING 6 HOURS ON INSTAGRAM REELS. WE GOT SOME T-SHIRTS AND THEN SAT DOWN FOR LUNCH. ONE OF JEFFS OLD STUDENTS WAS THERE!</p>

            <p style="margin-top:175%;">AFTER LUNCH, WE DECIDED TO WALK BACK TO THE HOTEL WITH KIERSTEN AND MAYAH, AND DROP OFF ALL 15 SHIRTS THAT WE GOT FROM THE EXPO HALLS. ON OUR WAY BACK TO THE CONVENTION CENTER, WE WENT TO STARBUCKS AGAIN (WE WERE TIRED). WE DECIDED TO GO TO A TALK ABOUT CREATING AN APP THAT HELPS WITH MATH FROM 1ST GRADE TO CALCULUS. IT WAS QUITE INTERESTING BUT, A LITTLE TOO ADVANCED FOR OUR LEVEL. WE REALIZED THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY TALKS TO GO TO AFTERWARDS SO WE SAT AND DID HOMEWORK. BLU WROTE THEIR ECONOMICS ESSAY AND OLIVE COMPLETED A MATH PACKET.</p>

            <p>BLU GOT AN EMAIL SAYING THAT THERE WERE GOODIES FOR POSTER PRESENTERS. SO, AFTER THE AMAZING TALK, WE DECIDED TO LOOK FOR THE GREEN ROOM. WHEN WE FOUND IT, THERE WAS A TUTORIAL GOING ON, SO WE DECIDED TO GO BACK TO THE HOTEL INSTEAD. WE WALKED BACK TO THE HOTEL IN THE RAIN, ATE SOME SNACKS, WATCHED A MOVIE AND DID SOME HOMEWORK.</p>

            <p>WE FINALLY DECIDED TO HEAD BACK TO THE CONVENTION CENTER FOR ONE LAST TALK FOR THE DAY. IT RAINED EXTREMELY HARD, SO WE WERE THANKFUL TO HAVE PACKED AN UMBRELLA FOR THE TRIP. THE TALK WE WENT TO WAS ABOUT A PODCAST ABOUT WOMENS CONTRIBUTIONS IN PYTHON!! THE PODCAST IS CALLED "THE HIDDEN FIGURES OF PYTHON." WE HAD BEEN ON OUR FEET ALL DAY SO BLU'S HIPS ALMOST DIE. WE END UP WALKING BACK TO THE HOTEL.</p>

WE ALL DECIDED TO GO TO A PLACE CALLED BAE BAE'S KITCHEN, RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER FROM OUR HOTEL. IT WAS A SMALL RESTURANT, SO WE MADE SURE TO GET A RESERVATION. WHEN WE GOT TO THE TABLE, THEY HAD A RESERVATION SET UP FOR 12 PEOPLE, NOT 10, SO THEY TOOK A TABLE BACK AND SQUISHED US ALL TOGETHER. IT WAS UNCOMFY SO JEFF AND SHEEL WENT AND TOOK THE TABLE BACK AFTER THE WAITOR HAD LEFT. JEFF AND DR. CHUCK CHATTED ABOUT AP COMPUTER SCIENCE AND IF IT WAS BENEFICIAL OR NOT. JEFF FINDS OUT THAT THE ARLINGTON CAREER CENTER, OUR SCHOOL, WILL BE RENAMED <a href="https://www.arlnow.com/2024/05/17/grace-hopper-center-to-be-career-centers-new-name-after-project-groundbreaking/">"THE GRACE HOPPER CENTER."</a> THAT WAS A BIG DEAL!! EVENTUALLY WE CLOSE OUT THE NIGHT AND SAY GOODBYE TO EVERYONE AND HEAD BACK TO THE HOTEL.</p>
